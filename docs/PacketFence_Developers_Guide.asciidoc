Documentation
-------------

The in-depth or more technical documentation is always as close to the code
as possible. Always look at the `POD` doc
footnote:[Perl's Plain Old Documentation: http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html].
To do so, the preferred way is using the `perldoc` command as follows:

  perldoc lib/pfconfig/cached.pm


== Asciidoctor documentation

=== Documentation Conventions

==== Shell commands in code blocks

.To ease copy-paste of shell commands:
* Remove useless characters in code blocks like `#` or `$`
* Split long lines with `\`

==== Titles

We use `=` tags for section titles (headings), see

Code conventions
----------------

Code style
~~~~~~~~~~

CAUTION: Work in progress.

We are slowly migrating away from an automated `perltidy` code style. The
reason we are not doing another pass of tidy is that it messes up code
history and makes maintainer's job more complicated than it should be. Every
new change uses the new guidelines so over time the old code style will
slowly disappear.

* Lines of 120 character width maximum

* No tab characters

* Stay consistent with surrounding white spaces

* Document each subroutine in POD format (`perldoc perlpod`)

* Use constants instead of hard coded strings or numbers (use `constant` or `Readonly` modules)

* in object-oriented modules we use CamelCase footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase]
  notation (ex: `$radiusRequest->getVoIpAttributes();`)

* in procedural modules we use Perl's usual notation (ex: `$node_info{'pid'} = $current_request{'pid'};`)

* regular expressions should be documented (with the `/x` modifier)

    if ($phone_number =~ /
        ^\(?([2-9]\d{2})\)?  # captures first 3 digits allows parens
        (?:-|.|\s)?          # separator -, ., space or nothing
        (\d{3})              # captures 3 digits
        (?:-|.|\s)?          # separator -, ., space or nothing
        (\d{4})$             # captures last 4 digits
        /x) {
            return "$1$2$3";
    }

* `SQL` should be capitalized, properly indented and always use named fields (no *)

    $node_statements->{'node_add_sql'} = get_db_handle()->prepare(<<'SQL');
        INSERT INTO node (
            mac, pid, category_id, status, voip, bypass_vlan,
            detect_date, regdate, unregdate, lastskip,
            user_agent, computername, dhcp_fingerprint,
            last_arp, last_dhcp,
            notes,
        ) VALUES (
            ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
        )
    SQL


== HTTP JSON API


PacketFence provides an HTTP JSON API which exposes most of its functionality. 

The full API specification for:

* the latest stable release is available from: https://packetfence.org/doc/api/
* the latest devel release is available from: https://packetfence.org/doc/api-devel/

The API is exposed on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) as well as the management interface of the server for remote calls.
Users access the API on TCP port 9999 over a secure connection (HTTPS).

Authentication can be done using either the webservices credentials or any credentials that are valid on the web admin interface.

=== How to use the API

==== On a PacketFence server

The [command]`pfperl-api` command located in [filename]`/usr/local/pf/sbin/`
directory can be use directly from a PacketFence server to query the API without having to specify an authentication token
and extra-parameters.

Example to get your general configuration:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/pf/sbin/pfperl-api get /api/v1/config/base/general \
| python -m json.tool
----

Example to create a node:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/pf/sbin/pfperl-api get -M POST /api/v1/nodes/ \
-c '{"mac":"22:33:44:55:66:77","pid":"host/MYCOMPUTER"}' \
| python -m json.tool
----


==== On a different computer

NOTE: The API specification mentionned above provides ready-to-use curl commands through the "Try it out" button.

First, get an authentication token with the webservices credentials or an admin account:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST "https://PF_MANAGEMENT_IP:9999/api/v1/login" \
-H  "accept: application/json" \
-H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"admin\"}" \
--insecure |
python -m json.tool
----

You will get following response :

[source,json]
----
 {
    "token": "MY_TOKEN"
 }
----

Then use this token to query the API. The following example fetches the general configuration:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "https://PF_MANAGEMENT_IP:9999/api/v1/config/base/general" \
-H  "accept: application/json" \
-H  "Authorization: MY_TOKEN" \
--insecure |
python -m json.tool
----

Although the API should mostly stay the same, backward compatibility is not 100% guaranteed for the moment until the v1 API reaches full maturity.

Customizing PacketFence
-----------------------

Captive Portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Presentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

XHTML Templates
+++++++++++++++

Captive portal content use http://template-toolkit.org/[Template Toolkit]
templates. The default template files are located in `/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates`.
You can freely edit the `HTML` code in these files.

Each template relies on `layout.html` for the common top and bottom portions of the page.

Internationalized AUP
+++++++++++++++++++++

In the event that you need an Acceptable Usage Policy that should be translated in different languages in the captive portal, you can create specially named templates that will be used for different languages.

For example, if the browser locale is `es_ES`, creating a template named `aup_text.es.html` will display this AUP when it detects this locale.
Same goes for a browser with locale `en_US`, where creating a template named `aup_text.en.html` will be used for English browsers.

The template `aup_text.html` is used as the final fallback for all locales.

Note that you cannot use the full locale in the template name (i.e. `aup_text.en_US.html`) as only the two letter prefix should be used.

CSS
+++

The default stylesheet is the result of processing some http://sass-lang.com/[Sass] files structured around the solid https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss[inuitcss] architectural foundation.

* `/usr/local/pf/html/common/Gruntfile.js` -- the task runner configuration file
* `/usr/local/pf/html/common/package.js` -- the npm dependencies required to process the Sass files
* `/usr/local/pf/html/common/scss/` -- the directory containing the Sass source files
* `/usr/local/pf/html/common/styles.css` -- the generated stylesheet

In order to prepare your environment to process the Sass files, you need to install http://gruntjs.com/[grunt] (the task runner) and additional https://nodejs.org[nodejs] modules, including the various inuitcss components:

  sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
  cd /usr/local/pf/html/common
  npm install

Once all modules are downloaded, you can customize the Sass files and generate a new stylesheet:

  grunt dist

To change the color palette of the captive portal, modify the file `scss/_settings.colors.scss`.

Workflow
++++++++

When a `HTTP` request is received by the Apache web server, the following workflow happens:


. URL is compared against the redirection instructions in
  `/usr/local/pf/conf/httpd.conf.d/captive-portal-cleanurls.conf`

. Requested CGI script in `/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/` is executed

. CGI script calls a `generate_<type>` which is defined in `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf/web.pm`

. The `generate_<type>` function populate the proper template in
  `/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates` in order to render the page

Remediation Pages
+++++++++++++++++

The remediation page shown to the user during isolation are specified through
the URL parameter of the given security event in `/usr/local/pf/conf/security_events.conf`.
In its default configuration, PacketFence uses Template Toolkit to render text provided
in the directory `/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates/security_events` and obeys
to everything mentioned in the <<_presentation,Presentation>> section.


// TODO: should move in admin guide under advanced topics
Translations
++++++++++++

The language of the user registration pages is selected through the
`general.locale` configuration parameter. Translatable strings are handled
differently for the Remediation pages and the rest of the captive portal:

* Remediation pages
+
Strings defined in the security event pages (in `/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates/security_events`)
will be looked up in the translation files in `/usr/local/pf/conf/locale/..`
and if a translation is available the translated string will be the one
visible on the captive portal.
+
Also, if you create a security event template with the name of your locale in
`/usr/local/pf/html/captive-portal/templates/security_events` in the format:
`<template_name>.<locale_name>.html`. It will be loaded instead of the default
`<template_name>.html` and so you can put strings and HTML directly in your
target language without the hassle of escaping everything properly as you
would need to do with `gettext`.
+
For example, if `malware.es_ES.html` exists and you are using the `es_ES`
(Spanish) locale then it will be loaded instead of `malware.html` on a
security event set to load the `malware` template.
+
* Rest of the captive portal
+
In the templates, if a string is in a `i18n()` call it will be translated.
Also `pf::web` takes care of performing some of the other translations.


Adding custom fields to the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can, if needed, add additional fields to the PacketFence database. Keep in mind though that this
might lead to more work when you upgrade to the next PacketFence version. Depending on the degree of
integration of these fields with PacketFence, you'll have to execute one or more of the following steps

Adding a field to the database only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case, the field is part of one of the main PacketFence tables, but PacketFence is unaware of
it. PacketFence won't consult the field and won't be able to modify it. A possible usage scenario would be a
3rd party application which maintains this field.

Since PacketFence doesn't have to know about the field, all you have to do is execute your `SQL ALTER
TABLE` query and you are done.

Adding a field and giving PacketFence read-only access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case, PacketFence can show the contents of the table using both
`pfcmd` but won't be able to modify the contents of the field.

Start by modifying the database table using an `SQL ALTER TABLE` query.

Then, modify the Perl module having the same name as the table you have added the field to, i.e. If you
added the field to the node table, then edit `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf/node.pm`. You'll have to modify the
`SQL SELECT` queries at the beginning of the file to include your new field and, possibly the functions
using these queries. If your new field should be used in reports, the dashboard or graphs, you'll also
have to modify the queries in `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/graph.pm`, `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm`
and `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/dashboard.pm`.


Adding a field and giving PacketFence read-write access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by creating the read-only field as described above.

Then, modify the `SQL UPDATE` and `INSERT` queries in the database tables'
Perl module, as well as the associated functions.

VLAN assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence uses the `getRegisteredRole` function defined in `pf::role::custom`
to determine a node's VLAN. Here's the default function:

----
sub getRegisteredRole {
    #$switch is the switch object (pf::Switch)
    #$ifIndex is the ifIndex of the computer connected to
    #$mac is the mac connected
    #$node_info is the node info hashref (result of pf::node's node_view on $mac)
    #$conn_type is set to the connection type expressed as the constant in pf::config
    #$user_name is set to the RADIUS User-Name attribute (802.1X Username or MAC address under MAC Authentication)
    #$ssid is the name of the SSID (Be careful: will be empty string if radius non-wireless and undef if not radius)
    my ($self, $switch, $ifIndex, $mac, $node_info, $connection_type, $user_name, $ssid) = @_;

    my $logger = Log::Log4perl->get_logger();

    return $switch->getVlanByName('normalVlan');
}
----


As you can see, the function receives several parameters (such as the switch and full node details)
which allow you to return the VLAN in a way that matches exactly your needs!


SNMP
----

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good places to start reading about SNMP are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP
and http://www.net-snmp.org/.

When working with SNMP, you'll sooner or later (in fact more sooner than later) be confronted with having
to translate between OIDs and variable names. When the OIDs are part of the Cisco MIBs, you can use the
following tool to do the translation: http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/public.jsp. Otherwise, you'll
have to use `snmptranslate` for example and setup your own collection of MIBs, provided (hopefully) by
the manufacturer of your network equipment.

Obtaining switch and port information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are some example of how to obtain simple switch and port information using SNMP. We'll assume that
your switch understands SNMP v2, has the read community `public` defined and is reachable at `192.168.1.10`.

Switch Type
^^^^^^^^^^^

  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.10 sysDescr

Switchport indexes and descriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.10 ifDescr

Switchport types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.10 ifType

Switchport status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.10 ifAdminStatus
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.10 ifOperStatus

Supporting new network hardware
-------------------------------

PacketFence is designed to ease the addition of support for new network hardware referred to as Network
Devices. All supported network devices are represented through Perl objects with an extensive use of inheritance.
Adding support for a new product comes down to extending the `pf::Switch` class (in `/usr/local/pf/lib/pf`).

The starting point to adding support for a new network device should be the vendor's documentation! First
of all, you'll have to figure out the exact capabilities of the switch and how these capabilities will fit into
PacketFence. Is it a Switch, an Access-Point or a Wireless Controller?

Switch
~~~~~~

Will you be able to use only link change traps? Does your switch allow you to use MAC notification traps?
Port Security? MAC Authentication? 802.1X?

Link change capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to define a new class which inherits from `pf::Switch` and defines
at least the following functions:

[options="compact"]
* `getMacAddrVlan`
* `getVersion`
* `getVlan`
* `getVlans`
* `isDefinedVlan`
* `parseTrap`
* `_getMacAtIfIndex`
* `_setVlan`

The `parseTrap` function will need to return an hash with keys `trapType` and
`trapIfIndex`.  The associated values must be `up` or `down` for `trapType`
and the traps' `ifIndex` for `trapIfIndex`.  See a similar switch's
implementation for inspiration. Usually recent modules are better coded than
older ones.

MAC notification capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the functions mentioned for link change, you need to define the following
function:

* `isLearntTrapsEnabled`

Also, your `parseTrap` function will need to return `trapOperation`, `trapVlan`
and `trapMac` keys in addition to `trapType` equals `mac`. See a similar switch's
implementation for inspiration. Usually recent modules are better coded than
older ones.

Port security capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the functions mentioned for link change, you need to define the following
functions:

[options="compact"]
* `isPortSecurityEnabled`
* `authorizeMAC`

In this case, the `parseTrap` function needs to return `secureMacAddrViolation` for the
`trapType` key. See a similar switch's implementation for inspiration. Usually
recent modules are better coded than older ones.

MAC Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: Work in progress

NAS-Port translation
++++++++++++++++++++

Often the `ifIndex` provided by the switch in a RADIUS `Access-Request` is
not the same as it's real world physical equivalent. For example in Cisco
requests are in the 50xxx while physical ifIndex are 10xxx. In order for
PacketFence to properly shut the port or request re-authentication a
translation between the two is required. To do so provide an implementation
of the following interface:

* `NasPortToIfIndex`

MAC Authentication re-evaluation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MAC Authentication re-evaluation is necessary in order to provoke a VLAN change in the PacketFence
system. This happens for instance when a node is isolated based on an IDS event or when the user
successfully authenticates through the captive portal. The default implementation in
`pf::Switch` will bounce the port if there is no Voice over IP (VoIP) devices connected to the
port. Otherwise it will do nothing and send an email. If your device has specific needs (for example it
doesn't support RADIUS Dynamic VLAN Assignments) override:

* `handleReAssignVlanTrapForWiredMacAuth`

Please note that the default implementation works 99% of the time. If you
are unsure whether to override, it means you don't need to override.

Once the MAC Authentication works, add the Wired MAC Auth capability to the switch's code with:

  sub supportsWiredMacAuth { return $TRUE; }


802.1X
^^^^^^

NOTE: Work in progress

NAS-Port translation
++++++++++++++++++++

Often the `ifIndex` provided by the switch in a RADIUS `Access-Request` is
not the same as it's real world physical equivalent. For example in Cisco
requests are in the 50xxx while physical ifIndex are 10xxx. In order for
PacketFence to properly shut the port or request re-authentication a
translation between the two is required. To do so provide an implementation
of the following interface:

* `NasPortToIfIndex`

So far the implementation has been the same for MAC Authentication and 802.1X.

Force 802.1X re-authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

802.1X re-authentication is necessary in order to provoke a VLAN change in the PacketFence system.
This happens for instance when a node is isolated based on an IDS event or when the user successfully
authenticates through the captive portal. The default implementation in `pf::Switch` uses SNMP and the
standard `IEEE8021-PAE-MIB` and is generally well supported. If the default implementation to
force 802.1X re-authentication doesn't work override:


* `dot1xPortReauthenticate`

Proper 802.1X implementations will perform re-authentication while still allowing traffic to go
through for supplicants under re-evaluation.

Once the `802.1X` works, add the Wired Dot1X capability to the switch's code with:

  sub supportsWiredDot1x { return $TRUE; }

RADIUS Dynamic Authorization (RFC3576)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: RADIUS Dynamic Authorization implementation is not recommended on the wired side at this point.

RADIUS Dynamic Authorization also known as RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) or RADIUS Disconnect
Messages is supported by PacketFence starting with version 3.1.

On wired network devices CoA can be used to change the security posture of a MAC and perform other
functions like bounce a port. So far we only encountered support for CoA on the wired side on the Cisco
hardware. For an implementation example check `_radiusBounceMac` in `pf::Switch::Cisco`.

Floating Network Devices Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Floating Network Devices are described in the Administration Guide under "Floating Network Devices" in
the "Optional Components" section. Refer to this documentation if you don't know what Floating Network
Devices are.

In order to support Floating Network Devices on a switch, you need to implement the following
methods:

[options="compact"]
* `setPortSecurityEnableByIfIndex($ifIndex, $enable)`
* `isTrunkPort($ifIndex)`
* `setModeTrunk($ifIndex, $enable)`
* `setTaggedVlans($ifIndex, $switch_locker_ref, @vlans)`
* `removeAllTaggedVlans($ifIndex, $switch_locker_ref)`

You might need to implement the following:

* `enablePortConfigAsTrunk($mac, $switch_port, $switch_locker, $taggedVlans)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as the glue between `setModeTrunk()`,
`setTaggedVlans()` and `removeAllTaggedVlans()`. Override if necessary.

* `disablePortConfigAsTrunk($switch_port)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as the glue between `setModeTrunk()`,
`setTaggedVlans()` and `removeAllTaggedVlans()`. Override if necessary.

* `enablePortSecurityByIfIndex($ifIndex)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as a slim accessor to
`setPortSecurityEnableByIfIndex()`. Override if necessary.

* `disablePortSecurityByIfIndex($ifIndex)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as a slim accessor to
`setPortSecurityEnableByIfIndex()`. Override if necessary.

* `enableIfLinkUpDownTraps($ifIndex)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as a slim accessor to
`setIfLinkUpDownTrapEnable`. Override if necessary.

* `disableIfLinkUpDownTraps($ifIndex)`
+
Provided by `pf::Switch` core as a slim accessor to
`setIfLinkUpDownTrapEnable`. Override if necessary.

Once all the required methods are implemented, enable the capability in the switch's code with:

  sub supportsFloatingDevice { return $TRUE; }


Wireless Access-Points or Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimum hardware requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence's minimum requirements regarding Wireless hardware is:

[options="compact"]
* definition of several SSID with several VLANs inside every SSID (minimum of 2 VLANs per SSID)
* RADIUS authentication (MAC Authentication / 802.1X)
* Dynamic VLAN assignment through RADIUS attributes
* a means to de-associate or de-authenticate a client through CLI (Telnet or SSH),
  SNMP, RADIUS Dyn-Auth footnote:[RADIUS Dynamic Authorization (RFC 3576) aka
  Change of Authorization (CoA) or Disconnect-Messages (DM aka PoD)] or WebServices

Most of these features are available on enterprise grade Access Points (AP) or Controllers.
Where the situation starts to vary wildly is for deauthentication support.

De-authentication techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CLI (SSH or Telnet)
+++++++++++++++++++

An error prone interface and requires preparation for the SSH access or is insecure for Telnet. Not
recommended if you can avoid it.

SNMP
++++

SNMP de-authentication works well when available. However Vendor support is not consistent and the
OID to use are not standard.

RADIUS Dynamic Authorization (RFC3576)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

RADIUS Dynamic Authorization also known as RADIUS Change of Authorization (CoA) or RADIUS
Disconnect Messages is supported by PacketFence starting with version 3.1. When supported it is the
preferred technique to perform de-authentication. It is standard and requires less configuration from the
user.

An actual implementation can be found in `pf::Switch::Aruba`.

Template module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start with a copy of the template module `pf/lib/pf/Switch/WirelessModuleTemplate.pm`
and fill in appropriate documentation and code.

Required methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to implement at least:

`getVersion()`::
  Fetches firmware version

`parseTrap()`::
  Parses the SNMP Traps sent by the hardware. For wireless hardware an empty method
  like the one in `pf::Switch::WirelessModuleTemplate` is ok.

`deauthenticateMac()`::
  Performs deauthentication

`supportsWirelessMacAuth()`::
  Return `$TRUE` if MAC-Authentication is supported

`supportsWirelessDot1x()`::
  Return `$TRUE` if 802.1X (aka WPA-Enterprise) is supported

Override methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If default implementation of the following methods doesn't work you will need to override them:

`extractSsid()`::
  Extract SSID from RADIUS Request

Special case: bridged versus tunneled modes and deauthentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to validate the Access-Point (AP) to Controller relationship when operating in bridged
mode versus when operating in tunneled mode. For example, some hardware will send the RADIUS `Access-Request`
from the AP when in bridged mode even though it is controlled by a controller. This behavior impacts
deauthentication because it still needs to be performed on the controller. To support this behavior a
`switches.conf` parameter was introduced: `controller_ip`.

When adding a new Wireless module try to validate the bridged versus tunneled behavior and modify
`deauthenticateMac()` to honor `controller_ip` if required.

The "adding a new network device module in PacketFence" checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a quick rundown of the several files you need to edit in order to add a new switch into
PacketFence. There's a plan to reduce this amount of work in progress see
http://packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1085[issue #1085].

[options="compact"]
* Tested model and firmware version should be documented in module's POD
* Any bugs and limitations should be documented in module's POD
* Make sure that all tests pass
* Add configuration documentation to the Network Devices Guide
* Add switch to the Network Devices Guide's switch chart
* Add switch to the chart in `README.network-devices`


== PacketFence builds

include::packer/README.asciidoc[]

== Developer recipes

=== Virtual environment

To test PacketFence on several distributions, we used Vagrant virtual machines. You can set up
a similar environment to develop.

==== Virtual environment: prerequisites

Install following softwares:
* link:https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/[Vagrant] (>= 1.9.3)
* Virtualbox if you wan to use Virtualbox as a provider for Vagrant
* libvirt, KVM/QEMU and vagrant-libvirt if you want to use libvirt as a provider for Vagrant

==== Virtual environment: initial setup

.Install Ansible and PacketFence's source code:
[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y git python-pip
pip install --user ansible
git clone https://github.com/inverse-inc/packetfence.git
----

.Install PacketFence's collection and Ansible roles:
[source,bash]
----
cd packetfence/addons/vagrant
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
----

.Start a virtual machine
[source,bash]
----
vagrant up VM_NAME
----

=== Running development version

==== Bleeding edge

For day to day development one can run a checkout of the current development branch in
`/usr/local/pf/` and develop there within a working setup.


==== Not so bleeding edge

If you prefer to use packages, you can install latest PacketFence packages from nightly builds.

===== Initial setup

Install <<_virtual_environment_prerequisites,prequisites>> and follow
<<_virtual_environment_initial_setup,initial setup>> then start `pf*night`
machines.

These machines will be auto-configured to install nightly builds from development
repositories.

===== Packages from PPA

If you want to install latest packages built in the pipeline, available on
link:https://inverse-inc.gitlab.io/packetfence/[GitLab], you can use
following commands:

[source,bash]
----
CI_PROJECT_NAME="ppa" CI_PAGES_URL="http://inverse-inc.gitlab.io/packetfence" vagrant up VM_NAME
----

WARNING: Packages available here could be build on other branches than devel.


===== Day to day usage

To keep your machine up-to-date, you can run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
vagrant provision --provision-with=config VN_NAME
----

Make sure you read the <<PacketFence_Upgrade_Guide.asciidoc#,Upgrade Guide>> after every upgrades to avoid any surprises.

===== Running an Ansible playbook against Vagrant virtual machines

If you want to use Ansible directly against Vagrant virtual machines (already started), you can use following commands:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit VM_NAME
----

It's possible because we use a static Ansible inventory. This inventory is
also used by Vagrant to start virtual machines.

===== Specific version of a package

If you want to install a specific version of a package, you can create a YAML
file that override default inventory, for example:

[source,bash]
----
cat >> extra.yml << EOF
packetfence_install__centos_packages:
  - packetfence-9.2.0-20191126180126.98740132.0007.el7
EOF
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit VM_NAME -e @extra.yml
----

== Contributing


Here are some golden rules of contributing to PacketFence:

* Be active on the https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/packetfence-devel[developer mailing list]

The place to be if you want to contribute to the PacketFence project is our developers mailing list:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/packetfence-devel. Let us know your issues, what you are
working on and how you want to solve your problems. The more you collaborate the greater the chances that
your work will be incorporated in a timely fashion.

* Use the issue tracker: https://packetfence.org/bugs/

Good chances that the bug you want to fix or the feature you want to implement is already filed and
that information in the ticket will help you.

* Please provide small, focused and manageable patches or pull-requests

If you plan on doing a lot of code, use `git` and track our current stable branch called `stable`. Develop the
feature in small chunks and stay in touch with us. This way it'll be merged quickly in our code base. Ideally
there would be no big code dumps after finishing a feature.

Creating patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: Since we migrated to git / github, using these tools is recommended
over sending patches by hand.

Patches should be sent in unified diff format. This can be obtained from the
`diff` or `git` tools.

  diff -u oldfile newfile

or from a checkout of the PacketFence source code from `git`:

  git diff

Translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The internationalization process uses `gettext`. If you are new to `gettext`, please consult
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Overview for a quick introduction.

The PO files are stored in `/usr/local/pf/conf/locale`. List that directory to see the languages
we currently have translations for.

Online using Transifex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the hosted service Transifex to translate PacketFence's PO files. It offers the
possibility to translate all the strings online as well as providing a command-line tool to push your
changes. It's very convenient.

To use Transifex, you must first sign up for a free account here: https://www.transifex.net/plans/signup/free/

* Once registered, https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/packetfence/teams[request a new team for your language]
* Once authorized, you'll be able to start/continue translating PacketFence in your language

If you need further help about using Transifex, you might want to have http://help.transifex.com/[a look here].

Using traditional method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to add support for a new language, please follow these steps:

[options="compact"]
. create a new language subdirectory in `/usr/local/pf/conf/locale`
. change into your newly created directory
. create a new subdirectory `LC_MESSAGES`
. change into your newly created directory
. copy the file `/usr/local/pf/conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/packetfence.po` into your directory
. translate the message strings in `packetfence.po`
. create the MO file by executing:

  /usr/bin/msgfmt packetfence.po

Submit your new translation to the PacketFence project by contacting us at packetfence-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

Admin GUI
~~~~~~~~~

The Admin GUI can be customized via Controllers and templates.

Templates
^^^^^^^^^

You can add customize templates to the `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root-custom/` folder to override current templates.

However when doing this you must keep track of any changes to those templates across versions.

Stylesheets and JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main stylesheet is the result of processing some http://sass-lang.com/[Sass] files structured around the excellent http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/[Bootstrap] framework.

* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/Gruntfile.js` -- the task runner configuration file
* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/package.js` -- the npm dependencies required to process the Sass files and to package the JavaScript code
* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/bower.json` -- the list of required components
* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/scss/` -- the directory containing the Sass source files
* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/css/styles.css` -- the generated stylesheet
* `/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/js/vendor/` -- the directory containing the external JavaScript libraries

In order to prepare your environment, you need to install http://gruntjs.com/[grunt] (the task runner) and https://bower.io/[bower] (the package manager):

  sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
  sudo npm install -g bower
  cd /usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/root/static/
  npm install
  bower install

Once all modules and components are downloaded, you can customize the Sass files or JavaScript files and generate a new version of the static files:

  grunt dist


Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^

You change the behavior of the controllers by modifying the controllers in the path.

`/usr/local/pf/html/pfappserver/lib/pfappserver/Controller/`

However when doing this you must keep track of any changes to those Controllers across versions.
